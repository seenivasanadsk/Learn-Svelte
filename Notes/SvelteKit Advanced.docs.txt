Hooks
  * Hooks makes custmozie the apps default behaviour "src/hooks.server.js"
  * handle - export async function handle in the hooks file, its like a middleware, we can do anything
  * event.locals - this is used for send some data to every request if we set this value we can read it any request
  * handleFetch - export async function handleFetch({ event, request, fetch })
    * It will work if we called event.fetch inside the load functions only
  * handleError - export function handleError({ event, error })

Page Options
  * in Page options we can tell the page is should render in server side, or clinet side or pre render at build time, also trailing slash
  * ssr - we can enable or disbale ssr in +page.server.js file by export a variable "export const ssr = false", default every page is server render
  * csr - we can enable or disbale csr in +page.server.js file by export a variable "export const csr = false"
  * prerender - we can enable or disbale prerender in +page.server.js file by export a variable "export const prerender = false" (its not work in dev mode)
  * trailingSlash - we can add or remove slash on the end of the url by these  "export const trailingSlash = 'always'"
    * always - means it add slash even though user not put it
    * ignore - means it users defined
    * never - means it remove slash even though user added it (default)

Link Options
  * Preloading - [NOT_WORKING_PROPERLY_ON_TRY] only "hover" works on try, "viewport, eager" not working (even production build also)
  * Reloading - "data-sveltekit-reload" if we put these attribute on parent element of <a> link it reload full page (in default it works smoth navigation on client side)

Advanced Routing
  * [[optional]]  - makes optional parmeteres
  * [...catchall] - makes multiple segements
  * Param matchers - makes specific paremeers allows only specific words or logics
    * in these file "src/params/hex.js" we can export a function called match which pass argument as value and we do logics here and return true or false
    * the folder path for routes is "src/routes/colors/[color=hex]" here the hex is same both places
  * (gruped) - this is grouped routes it is not affect the URL segements but we can organize, it works for using "+layout.svelte.js" but not works for "+page.svelte.js"
  * Breaking out of layers - in default every layout is rendred in the page if we access multiple nested pages
    * we can break the layout by adding "+page@SEGMENT.svelte" its only apperas a rootlayout to SEGMENT we described other inners are skipped

Advanced Loading
  * we alredy know that "+page.server.js", but it only runs on server, sometimes we need client side load function we can use with "+page.js"
    * "+page.server.js" - run only server, "+page.js" - runs both client and server, both has load function, page.server.js load function run first
  * the "+page.js" file override the "+page.server.js" returned data, the component receives the data from "+page.js" and the "+page.js" receives the server file data.
    * if we want both data we should concadinate both in "+page.js"
  * Using parent data - we can use parent layout data from here by calling parent paremeter with await keyword.
    * (but server load file return to server load file, and univeral file return to univeral file)
  * invalidate       - [IGNORED|NOT_UNDERSTANDABLE]
  * custom depednecy - [IGNORED|NOT_UNDERSTANDABLE]
  * invalidateAll    - [IGNORED|NOT_UNDERSTANDABLE]

Environment variable
  * $env/static/private - Access build time parsed variable in server side
  * $env/dynamic/private - Access run time parsed variable in server side (must restart the server)
  * $env/static/public - Access build time parsed variable in client side
  * $env/dynamic/public - Access run time parsed variable in client side
