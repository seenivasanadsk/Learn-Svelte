Hooks
  * Hooks makes custmozie the apps default behaviour "src/hooks.server.js"
  * handle - export async function handle in the hooks file, its like a middleware, we can do anything
  * event.locals - this is used for send some data to every request if we set this value we can read it any request
  * handleFetch - export async function handleFetch({ event, request, fetch })
    * It will work if we called event.fetch inside the load functions only
  * handleError - export function handleError({ event, error })

Page Options
  * in Page options we can tell the page is should render in server side, or clinet side or pre render at build time, also trailing slash
  * ssr - we can enable or disbale ssr in +page.server.js file by export a variable "export const ssr = false", default every page is server render
  * csr - we can enable or disbale csr in +page.server.js file by export a variable "export const csr = false"
