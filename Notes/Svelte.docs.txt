Introduction
  * The Svelte compoents has *.svelte extensions
  * it contains 3 parts <script>, <html>, <style> here styles are only scoped with in the compoent
  * we can use {}, to display js variable value in html

State
  * any variable that is used $state() is reactive
  * get some values based on state that is called $derived, derived is one way
  * we can log primitve data direclty, but when we log array or object we should use $inspect (developemnt only), if we want real value we can access by $state.snapshot
  * $effect get a function that run when any state change used with in it if nothing used it run only one time (don't use frequently)
  * we can return a function that is run before update or before destroy to clean up something from $effect
  * if we use $state in seprate.js file and used thate state variable in multiple times, we can make univesal reactivity

Props
  * we can pass any data to parent to child compoent
  * and also we can declare default values to the props in child compoent
  * we can spread props like {...object} to the compoent

Logics
  * We can use if condition on compoents by these {#if CONDITION} - starting, {/if} - ending, {:else}, {:else if CONDITION} - for middle here we can close curly braces for each statement
  * We can also use looping by {#each ITEMS as SINGLE_ITEM, INDEX (KEY)} - starting, {/each} - ending
  * We can direclty use asyncrohone handling here by {#await PROMISE} ... {:then RESULT} ... {:catch ERROR} ... {/await}

Events
  * We can use events in Svelte same os onclick, onkeydown like these
  * In default event trigger in bubbling mood (child to parent), we can make like [onclickcapture, onkeydowncapture] to run event on capturing mode (parent - child)
  * we can pass event handler to children compoent via props

Binding
  * we can bind any input element to the reactive state using "bind:value". its consider boolean on checkbox and radio, string on text, number on number, etc...

Class & Styles
  * we can use {}, and any js expression in it, if we pass objects its assign its key when the value is true, if we pass array its consider all as classname
  * Same as Class, we can use {} and js expression in it, but unlike class it not accept object and array but it has special statement like (style:border=) like these
  * in Svelte, styles are scoped for each compoent, if we want to style a child comp from parent comp we can pass like "--color" props to the child which is not props actually
    it is passing styles from parent to child and we can access that in child comp style tag by var(--color)

Use Directive
  * This is run for native dom elements has update, create, destry time like events (use:FUNCTION)
  * we can pass parameter like use:FUNCTION={PARAMETER}
  * Svelte recommand to use $effect() instead of update(), destroy()

Transition
  * we can use transition effect on element render and non rendering time
  * in default, svelte provides (fade, blur, crossfade, draw, fly, scale, slide). here "draw" only works on svg and for "fly" we need to pass x and y axiois
  * if we put "transition" keyword it works on both time visible and hide, when we give "in" and "out" seperatly it work diffently
  * We can also add custom transition by (transition:spin={{duration}}) here spin is a function and duration is arguments
    * the transition function has two parameter first one is target node, second one is options passed as values
    * and it should return on objects with these keys (delay, duration, easing, css, tick)
      * delay - wait before transition begins
      * duration - how long its should do
      * easing - easing function (rarly used so skiped)
      * css - css function it has two parameter first is the from the starting time 0 to 1
        * the second parent is remaining time
        * these function runs each time based on display refresh-rate
        * and it should return a css native style string
      * tick - (there is exist but skiped raraly used)
  * We can also use JS based transition like typing by these (but skiped for now)
  * There is also have 4 event we can use for (onintrostart, onoutrostart, onintroend, onoutroend)
  * Global transition: when we specify a (transition:spin|global) like these then its trigger even thought its parent add or removed
    * If we not use global then the transition only happen the element it self add or removed, if the parent added or removed its not work
  * Sometimes we need to reapply the transition without the dom updates, in that case we can enclosed by key scopes {#key i}...{/key}
    * Here, the i means the index or any other things that change the dom
