Routing
  * Pages - we can define "+page.svelte" file inside "src/route" which is url routing and the folderpath is the routepath
  * Layouts - we can put common code into these file "+layout.svelte", A +layout.svelte file applies to every child route, including the sibling +page.svelte
  * Route Parameters - we can put any valid variable name with square bracked, to access a route dynamiclly "src/route/blog/[slug]" will be "/blog/DYNAMIC"

Loading Data
  * SvelteKit run three things in the core in the order of Routing (which route match incoming request), Loading (get data for the route), Rendering (generate some HTML)
  * Every page of your app can declare a load function in a +page.server.js file alongside the +page.svelte file
  * "+page.server.js" file only runs on the server, whatever we return from the load function, will available in data props in "+page.svelte"
  * the dynamic routes parameters can accessble in the load function arguemnts like ({params})
  * we can also use "+layout.server.js" in these file the data availale in all its children

Headers & Coolies
  * We can set a headers from load function of "+page.server.js" has a "setHeaders" arguments we can pass objects here to set headers
  * We can also get and set Cookies from load function same as setHeaders, cookies.get('visited'), cookies.set("visited", value, options), in options path is mandatory

Shared Modules
  * Every js module files in the "src/lib" folder is accessble in src folder by "$lib", here if "src/lib/message.js" can be "$lib/message.js"

Forms
  * Any form inside the "+page.svelte" if we don;t specified the action only method post it triggers the "+page.server.js" action object inside default function
  * We can also make a named actions in same actions object with any name and in the form actions we can call it (action="?/create"), default function not works in named actions
  * If we return a import { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit'; fail function with 1st args status code and 2nd args details in actions, we can get that in Svelte files
    * We can get a form props in svelte UI file and these form has error that is faild via fail function to diaplay a error message
  * Svelte makes default full page relaod on form submit, if we want SPA we need to use import { enhance } from '$app/forms'; and in form tag (use:enhance)
  * We can pasuse a callback function for use:enhance to handle the starting, loading, finshed event of the submit, for more details visit (https://svelte.dev/tutorial/kit/customizing-use-enhance)

API routes
  * Same as pages we can also define API end points by "+server.js" file with export function with Method as function name it has parameters of request, url, cookies, setcookie, ipaddress etc...

$app/state
  * SvelteKit makes three available options via these module. page, navigating, and updated
    * page - it has objects and has
      * url — the URL of the current page
      * params — the current page’s parameters
      * route — an object with an id property representing the current route
      * status — the HTTP status code of the current page
      * error — the error object of the current page, if any (you’ll learn more about error handling in later exercises)
      * data — the data for the current page, combining the return values of all load functions
      * form — the data returned from a form action
    * navigating - Represents the current navigation.
      * from and to — objects with params, route and url properties
      * type — the type of navigation, e.g. link, popstate or goto
    * updates - [IGNORED]
